      Intro
  </h3>
  <p class="projectText">I wanted a website which was essentially a blog about every project I completed.
      My <a class="projectLink" href="https://jacobeckroth.com" title="Main Website">main website</a> would theoretically
      have worked for this, but I felt it was prudent to separate them into 2 separate websites. Additionally, my main website
      is built on React which from my experience works best for single-page applications.

  <p class="projectText">
      This website is running using <a class="projectLink" href="https://handlebarsjs.com/" title="Handlebars">Handlebars</a> as a templating engine.
      It is running off of an express server that is running on an AWS free tier server (yay free things). Overall
      the layout is very simple, and doesn't require very complex components, because it is mostly text. This makes my job easier,
      but at the same time it also reduces it's uniqueness as compared to some of my other projects.
  </p>
  <h3 class="sectionHeader">
      That's about it
  </h3>
  <p class="projectText">
      There really isn't much else to say about my portfolio. It's pretty self explanatory. I would include some images,
      but I think that you understand why that would be completely useless. Ok go look at my more interesting projects now.
